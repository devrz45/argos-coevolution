This experiment involved a simple evolution of prey neuro-controller within a multi agent environment. The environment consisted of 3 predator bots which were programmed to case the nearest prey, and 25 prey bots which were uniformly placed throughout the environment. The trials involved using the best evolved controller in various scenarios and dynamic environments.
